*   Flexbox Container Properties
    *   `flex-direction`
        *   specifies how items are placed in the flex container, defining the main axis and it's direction
        *   default value is `row`
        *   `row-reverse` reverses the direction of the main axis
        *   `column` makes it go down starting with first item at the top
        *   `column-reverse` makes it go down starting with last item at the top
    *   `justify-content`
        *   defines how space is distributed between items in flex container along the main axis
            *   `: flex end` moves all content to the right side
            *   `: center` centers content with spaces on both sides
            *   `: space-between` gives equal space between elements, no space on ends
            *   `: space-around` gives equal amount of space to both sides of an item
    *   `flex-wrap`
        *   specifies whether items are forced into a single line OR can be wrapped into multiple lines
        *   `flex-wrap: wrap`
    *   `align-items`
        *   defines how space is distributed between items in flex container along the corss axis
        *   `: flex-start` items aligned top of cross axis
        *   `: flex-end` items aligned bottom of cross axis
        *   `: stretch` items are stretched to fill entire cross axis (default value)
        *   `: center` items are centered along cross axis
        *   `: baseline` align items based on the baseline of the text/font
    *   `align-content`
        *   defines how space is distrubuted BETWEEN ROWS in flex container along the cross axis
        *   `: flex-start` items aligned top
        *   `: flex-end` items aligned bottom
        *   `: space-between` first and last rows get pushed to top and bottom, equal space in between
        *   `: space-around` equal space between rows, 1/2 that amount of space between top and bottom
        *   `: center` aligns in the center with no space between rows, equal space top and bottom
*  Flexbox Flex Item Properties
    *  `order` specifies the order used to layout items in their clex container
        *  all itmes by default have an order of '0', use negative
    *  `flex` defines how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the available space in a container
        *  shothand property for 3 other properties
            *  `flex-basis` sort of like width (rows) or height (columns), but not; specifies the ideal size of a flex item BEFORE it's palced into a flex container
            *  `flex-grow` dictates how the unused space should be spread amongst flex items
            *  `flex-shrink` dictates how items should shrink when there isn't enough space in container
                *  1 is default value
